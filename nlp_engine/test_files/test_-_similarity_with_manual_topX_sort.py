## SORT ONLY THOSE MUCH SIMILARITIES THAT ARE NEEDED - all_documents_similarity_sorted - dont sort all 7000 entires using the inbuilt sorted function - Tried this, did not significantly change the runtime
## LSH HASHING - BUCKETS 8-10 
## Sklearn KNN
## WHAT IF WE REMOVE POS and LEMMATIZATION PART AND DIRECTLY PASS test_description in find_similarity()
## WHAT IF WE USE inbuilt KNN function instead of COSINE SIMILARITY
## WHAT IF WE REDUCE VOCAB SIZE TO 7000 or something like that - Tried this, it largely reduced the runtime with negligible change in accuracy. Also, try Text summarization? - Might decrease accuracy but also decrease running time

## UPDATE ON SERVER CODE

## Frontend display:
### Page 1:
#### Show success or failure
#### show average rating rounded off
#### Show your pecentile/ranking w.r.t all other apps in the app store. And w.r.t genre as well?
#### Show genre of app
#### Show potential number of total installs
#### Show potential number of total users that will rate
#### Selling potential by number of installs and rating. 1-2 - Wont sell, 2-3.5 medium sell, 3.5-4.5 - Good sell, 4.5-5... and so on
### Page 2:
#### show equalized graph of number of users by rating
### Page 3:
#### Pie/Bar Chart of number of users by age group
### All pages:
#### show top 3 apps similar and their description excript (most important text summarized?) and their similarity percentage,  and show only 1 or 2 or none if similarity less than 0.2? Showing their number of installs/user ratings doesnt give decent results
#### Are the top 3 Free or paid? Mention. Whether you should put a prize on your app considering free and paid analysis of topXpercent apps?
#### For more detailed analysis - Sign up for premium/login

#### IMPORTANT NOTE - The feature that will make this system very helpful to the developers - Which functionality or "keyword" to add into your description/implementation to make it more successful, increase rating, number of installs, etc


## To Do:
## Find such description that will have average rating less than 3.0
